This file is designed to use the Spotify API to gather audio features about streamed tracks. The data 
is then saved to disk so that the Spotify API doesn't need to be pinged whenever a user refreshes 
the Streamlit dashboard. 

This script should be run once as a single preprocessing step before the dashboard can be run. 

This script can be run from the command line by running: $ python3 get_audio_features.py
