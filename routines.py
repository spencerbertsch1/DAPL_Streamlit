This file contains a few helper functions needed to load the .json files from spotify to memory using 
pandas, clean and join a few dataframes, grab the genres usingt the Spotify API. We then write the 
resulting dataframe back down to disk as a .csv file. 

This light processing is needed so that we can use the resulting .csv file as the data source for our 
Streamlit Spotify dashboard.
